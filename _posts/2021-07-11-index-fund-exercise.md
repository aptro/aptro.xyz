[Body by Science](https://www.amazon.in/Body-Science-John-Little/dp/0071597174/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=body+by+science&qid=1626019444&sr=8-1) by Doug McGuff and John Little talks about the science and craft of building muscles, including the importance of muscle building, effective exercise techniques, and the impact of muscle mass on metabolism.

The book introduces five sets of compound exercises that cover the majority of functional muscles. They are known as "The Big Five: Index Fund of Exercise". There are two variations: one with machines and one with free weights (barbell and plates).

I perform the "Big Five" one to two times a week with free weights. The entire setup costs around 30k INR (400$).
